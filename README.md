# Micro Frontend Architecture Comparison

This repository contains two different implementations of micro frontend architecture:

- **Solution 1**: A Module Federation-based approach using Vite
- **Solution 2**: A Web Components-based approach with Shadow DOM

Both solutions demonstrate different methods of implementing micro frontends in a distributed, multi-repository environment where each team can work independently.

## Key Architectural Differences

### Solution 1: Module Federation

- Uses Webpack/Vite Module Federation
- Shares dependencies with sophisticated version control
- JavaScript module-level integration
- Complex but mature ecosystem

### Solution 2: Web Components

- Uses native Web Components with Shadow DOM
- Import Maps for dependency sharing
- Complete CSS isolation via Shadow DOM
- Native browser standards-based approach

## Getting Started

Each solution directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions:

- [Solution 1 Documentation](./solution1/README.md)
- [Solution 2 Documentation](./solution2/README.md)

## Distributed Architecture Approach

These solutions are designed for distributed development where:

1. Each micro frontend has its own repository
2. Teams work independently
3. Deployments occur on separate schedules
4. Each micro frontend has its own build process
5. Version management is handled at runtime

## Detailed Comparison

For a comprehensive analysis of the two approaches, see the [Architecture Comparison](./MONOREPO_COMPARISON.md) document.

## Use Case Recommendations

- **Solution 1 (Module Federation)** is recommended for:

  - Large organizations with many independent teams
  - Complex applications with sophisticated state sharing needs
  - Teams that require strong version control for shared dependencies

- **Solution 2 (Web Components)** is recommended for:
  - Teams focused on web standards compliance
  - Applications requiring strict CSS isolation
  - Projects prioritizing simplicity and maintainability
